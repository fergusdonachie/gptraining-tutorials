## Main learning points

<Callout type="ok" title="Main learning points">
- Take a structured bleeding history: pattern, duration, flooding/clots, impact, intermenstrual bleeding (IMB)/postcoital bleeding (PCB), pregnancy risk, contraception/HRT.
- Screen for red flags and alternate diagnoses (pregnancy, infection, cervical pathology, cancer features, anticoagulants/bleeding disorder).
- Start with **simple primary care investigations** where appropriate (e.g. pregnancy test if relevant; FBC; consider ferritin; STI testing if indicated).
- Follow a **stepwise NG88-style approach**: shared decision-making, choose options based on likely cause, acceptability, and contraindications.
- Always safety-net and arrange follow-up to assess response and anaemia.
</Callout>

## Management summary (one page)

<Callout type="note" title="Management summary (one page)">
1) Clarify HMB vs other AUB (IMB/PCB/PMB)
2) Check pregnancy risk; screen for red flags
3) Initial tests: FBC ± ferritin; pregnancy test if relevant; consider STI tests if cervicitis risk; treat anaemia
4) First-line options (based on likely cause and patient preference)
   - LNG-IUS if suitable
   - If LNG-IUS unsuitable/declined: tranexamic acid / NSAID / combined hormonal contraception / cyclical oral progestogen (per guidance)
5) Review response and side effects; escalate/referral if persistent, structural suspicion, or red flags
</Callout>

## Cases

<Case title="Case 1 — bread and butter HMB">
  <Step title="Presenting problem" open>
  29-year-old: “My periods are really heavy and I’m exhausted.”

  **Discussion prompts:**
  - What questions quantify heaviness and impact?
  - What associated bleeding patterns change your differential (IMB/PCB/PMB)?
  - What contraception and pregnancy-risk questions matter here?
  </Step>

  <Step title="More history">
  Regular cycles. Flooding on day 1–2, clots. No IMB/PCB. No pelvic pain. Not on anticoagulants.

  **Discussion prompts:**
  - What baseline exam/tests do you do in primary care?
  - How will you screen for anaemia and treat it?
  - What are appropriate first-line treatment options?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Results & plan">
  FBC: Hb 102 g/L, microcytosis.

  **Discussion prompts:**
  - What do you prescribe for iron replacement and what counselling do you give?
  - What’s your follow-up interval?
  - When would you refer if she doesn’t improve?
  </Step>
</Case>

<Case title="Case 2 — HMB + IMB (investigation needed)">
  <Step title="Presenting problem" open>
  41-year-old: heavy periods plus spotting between periods for 3 months.

  **Discussion prompts:**
  - What are the key risk factors for endometrial pathology?
  - What does your exam need to document?
  - What investigations are appropriate (and what must not be delayed)?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Exam">
  Speculum: cervix appears benign. Bimanual: no mass, mild uterine enlargement.

  **Discussion prompts:**
  - When is pelvic ultrasound useful?
  - How do you safety-net and communicate uncertainty?
  </Step>
</Case>
