# Clinical Summary

> **Main Learning Points**
> * **History:** Quantify bleeding (flooding, clots), check impact on quality of life, and screen for red flags (PCB/IMB).
> * **Assessment:** Screen for anaemia and red flags. Speculum if IMB/PCB or cervical concerns.
> * **Management:** Follow **NG88 stepwise approach**. Mirena (LNG-IUS) is 1st line if acceptable.
> * **Safety Net:** Always arrange follow-up to assess response and check Hb.

## Case: The "Tired All The Time" Patient

### Step 1: Presentation
**Patient:** Sarah, 29-year-old female.
**Complaint:** "I'm just so exhausted, doctor. My periods have become unmanageable."

She describes cycles that leave her feeling "drained". She is changing protection every 2 hours on days 1-3.

> **Trainer Guidance**
> Ask the trainee to specifically quantify "heavy". Look for history of flooding, clots >1 inch, or need for double protection. Check for symptoms of anaemia (SOB, fatigue).

### Step 2: Detailed History
* **Cycle:** Regular 28-day cycle, bleeding lasts 7 days.
* **Pain:** Moderate cramping, managed with ibuprofen.
* **Red Flags:** No Intermenstrual Bleeding (IMB), No Post-coital Bleeding (PCB). Smear is up to date and normal.
* **Contraception:** Currently using condoms. Not seeking pregnancy.
* **Meds:** None. No family history of bleeding disorders.

> **Trainer Guidance**
> Discuss the differential diagnosis here. Since there is no IMB/PCB and the cervix is normal (assumed), structural pathology is less likely, but fibroids are possible.
> *Ask Trainee:* What is the first-line investigation? (FBC). Do we need an ultrasound immediately? (Not usually, unless mass felt or pharm treatment fails).

### Step 3: Examination & Results
**Abdominal Exam:** Soft, non-tender. No palpable uterus.
**Speculum:** Not strictly indicated if history is low risk (no IMB/PCB), but performed: Normal cervix.
**Investigations:**
* **FBC:** Hb 102 g/L (Microcytic). Ferritin 8.
* **Pregnancy Test:** Negative.
* **Coagulation:** Not indicated (no suggestive history).

> **Trainer Guidance**
> Management Planning Discussion:
> 1. **Anaemia:** Needs iron replacement.
> 2. **HMB Treatment:** Discuss NG88 hierarchy.
> * 1st Line: LNG-IUS (Mirena) - *Most effective*.
> * 2nd Line (Non-hormonal): Tranexamic Acid + NSAIDs.
> * 2nd Line (Hormonal): COCP or Oral Progestogens.

### Step 4: Outcome
Sarah declines the Coil (LNG-IUS) as she dislikes the idea of a procedure. She opts for **Tranexamic Acid** (1g TDS during menses) and **Mefenamic Acid**. She starts Ferrous Fumarate.

**Plan:** Review in 3 months to check bleeding control and repeat FBC.

## Case: HMB with Intermenstrual Bleeding

### Step 1: Presentation
**Patient:** Diane, 42-year-old female.
**Complaint:** Heaviness has increased over 6 months, but she is actually worried because she has noticed spotting a few days before her period starts.

> **Trainer Guidance**
> How does the management change with the addition of Intermenstrual Bleeding (IMB)?
> *Key Point:* IMB is a red flag for structural pathology (Polyps, Fibroids, Malignancy) or Infection. This patient **requires** physical examination and visualization of the cervix.

### Step 2: Assessment
**Speculum:** Cervix appears healthy. No polyps visible.
**Bimanual:** Bulky uterus (approx 10-12 week size), non-tender. mobile.

> **Trainer Guidance**
> *Decision Point:* A bulky uterus + IMB triggers the need for imaging.
> A **Transvaginal Ultrasound (TVUSS)** is now mandatory to exclude fibroids or endometrial pathology.
> *Referral Criteria:* If ultrasound shows polyp or submucosal fibroid, she needs Hysteroscopy. If endometrium is thickened (>10mm in pre-menopause usually acceptable, but clinical judgement applies regarding biopsy if IMB persistent).
